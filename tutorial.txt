When modifying 0201-00_07 (Defaults), DO NOT remove header from "Raw section", otherwise it will replace "AmiStandardDefaultsVariable" with a Variable GUID. Also it replaces "Free space" with "Padding", not good.

MMTool 4.50.0023 has 2 problems. First one, it does not recognize modules with "MM dependency section" within it. Second, when we save the ROM, the output filename will ALWAYS be lowercase...
Use MMTool 5.02.0024 Mod, it works flawlessly with my Aptio IV image.

Skipped modules to Extract:
- 00_00 | NVRAM | NVAR store
- 01_00 | FV_MAIN_NESTED | FV_MAIN_NESTED
- 01_01 | Microcode [real]. Need to update to the latest revisions every CPU microcode, plus need to fix alignment.
- 03_02 | Microcode [real]. Need to update to the latest revisions every CPU microcode, plus need to fix alignment.

List of modules that comes immediately after a "Padding file" that need correction (from Attributes: X8h to X0h):

- 01_01 | CPU microcodes [real one, also need to update them with the latest one] | From "Attributes: 48h" to "Attributes: 44h" (Fixed)
- 0201-00_02 | CPU microcodes [fake one]                                          | From "Attributes: 08h" to "Attributes: 00h"
- 03_02 | CPU microcodes [real one, also need to update them with the latest one] | From "Attributes: 48h" to "Attributes: 44h" (Fixed)
- 03_0B | BiosAc                                                                  | From "Attributes: 28h" to "Attributes: 00h"

To modify one default BIOS setting ("ACPI Debug" from "Disabled" to "Enabled"), we need to edit the BIOS is 3 different places:
- Setup module     | 01_04
- AMITSE/setupdata | 0201-00_81
- NVRAM            | 00_00 and 0201-00_07

Modify OEM DSDT with the custom one create with OpenCore ACPI>Patch
- AmiBoardInfo | 0201-00_0C

Add "HfsPlus" driver from acidanthera OcBinaryData repository. Create the PE32, UI. Then a Compressed none section of them. Finally GenFfs DXE driver with GUID "AE4C11C8-1D6C-F24E-A183-E1CA36D1A8A9".
